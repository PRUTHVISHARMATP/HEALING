        <h3>💗 Inner Shift</h3>
        <p>Over time, I experienced a deep emotional shift. It felt like a heavy weight I’d been carrying had started to lift. The space felt safe and supported throughout the journey.</p>

        <h3>🧠 Emotional Experience</h3>
        <p>My journey with Healing has been nothing short of transformative. I was dealing with chronic stress, emotional exhaustion, and a sense of imbalance. While other approaches helped a little, it was Energy Healing that brought deep and lasting change.</p>
        <h3>⚡ Physical Changes</h3>
        <p>Through regular sessions and self-practice, I felt lighter, more focused, and emotionally grounded. My fatigue turned into vitality, and I could sense clarity throughout the day.</p>
        <h3>🌺 Spiritual & Inner Shift</h3>
        <p>Healing helped me release long-held emotional patterns and reawaken a sense of spiritual connection I had completely lost. It showed me that healing is not just about the body—it’s about nurturing the soul and aligning with higher energies.</p>
        <h3>🙏 Gratitude</h3>
        <p>I am incredibly grateful to Shubha for guiding me through this process. It has truly changed how I think and respond to life. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking healing and deeper self-understanding. Thank you, Shubha, for being there for me always. 😊😊</p>

        <h3>My journey with Pranic Healing—through the Basic, Advanced, and Psychotherapy courses</h3>
        <p>It has been nothing short of exhilarating and deeply enlightening. Each level of training has helped me uncover powerful insights into the human energy system and how our physical, emotional, and mental bodies are interconnected and in need of regular healing and balance.</p>
        <p>The healing sessions I received, guided with immense care and patience by Shubha, were profoundly transformative. She ensured that the sessions were done only when I felt comfortable, which helped me build trust and experience the healing process at a deeper level. These sessions not only supported my emotional and physical well-being but also opened a new dimension of self-awareness for me.</p>
        <p>I’ve begun to understand my own behavioural patterns better—why certain reactions emerge in specific situations—and, more importantly, how to consciously regulate my emotional responses. This has brought in a sense of clarity, balance, and calmness in how I respond to life’s everyday challenges.</p>
        <p>I’m truly grateful for the healing, the teachings, and the gentle yet powerful way in which this knowledge has been passed on. It’s a journey I will always cherish, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking holistic well-being and inner transformation. Thank you, Shubha, for being there for me always.</p>
